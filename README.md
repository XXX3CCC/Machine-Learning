# Machine-Learning
Instructor: [Lili Mou](https://lili-mou.github.io/)

## Course Description:
Machine learning teaches a machine to learn from previous experience and makes a prediction for (possibly new) data. This course covers standard materials of a “Machine Learning” course, such as linear regression, linear classification, as well as non-linear models. In the process, we will have a systematic discussion on training criteria, inference criteria, bias-variance tradeoff, etc. The goal of the course is to build a solid foundation of machine learning, so there would be intensive math derivations in lectures, assignments, and exams. 


## Course Objectives and Expected Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this course, the student will understand the foundations of machine learning and gain experience in machine learning applications.
